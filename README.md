PHASE 1)
  Our Main intention was to complete research/Make use of flask (a python module that allows for application develop using an extendable core), in order to be able to make the parallel between our existing python code
  that manipulates our bread board and its visual output through an html live server.

  Our current submission includes css and html files corresponding to the visual aspect of the phase (manipulating the switch to toggle the lightbulb), assets containing images for our html and a python code
  allowing us to modify the physical light bulb's state when manipulating the visual one.

  To run, an extension of live server is required to host the web application.
